## E-commerce Customer Segmentation and Prediction

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce customer data to perform customer segmentation and build predictive insights using machine learning techniques.

### Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL concepts (filtering, grouping, aggregation logic)

### Role of SQL Concepts in This Project
- Customer and transaction-level data was processed using SQL-style operations such as filtering, grouping, aggregation, and joins
- Feature engineering steps like purchase frequency, total spending, and customer behavior metrics follow relational database logic
- The processed data is SQL-ready and can be directly migrated to a relational database for querying and reporting

### Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering at customer level
- Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Model evaluation and visualization

### Files
- Charitha Ecommerce file (1).ipynb – contains data preprocessing, segmentation, and prediction workflow
